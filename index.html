      <h3>Tony Chung</h3>
      <p> I have always been interested in either the economics side of the world or the computers. In the end, I decided to persue computers and it led me here. I have not had much, if not any prior experience to programming at all but its something I'm defintely willing to learn throughout the next few years.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 3D shape with sounds</h3>
    <p>In my project, I have started with a keypressed() methods which allowed for 2 sound files to be played to their corresponding keys which were '1' and '2'. I had to code this so that they did not overlap eachother when the key was pressed again or another one was pressed. I have also added a 3D shape which rotates on both axis upon startup. I would've liked to do some sort of reactive shape to sounds but not enough time and experience for that just yet.
